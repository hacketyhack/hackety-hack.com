# Hackety-Hack.com

This is the code for the website component of [Hackety Hack](http://hackety-hack.com). I'd explain more here, but it's better to just check out our generated documentation, which can get you started with running your own version of the site. You can find it [here](http://hacketyhack.github.com/hackety-hack.com/hackety.html) on the web, or on the `gh-pages` branch in this repository.

## Contributing

There's an [Issues tracker](http://github.com/hacketyhack/hackety-hack.com/issues) which is used to track both bugs and feature requests.

Please fork me and send a pull request, I'll be happy to apply any patches you might wish to offer, though if you're going to make major changes or modify look and feel, please send me a message or email (steve+hackety@steveklabnik.com) first, so that we can talk about it.
